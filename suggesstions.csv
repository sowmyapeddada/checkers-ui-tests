Additional Test cases:
We have a Checkers board that has 8 lines and each line has 8 Images. In order to differentiate each line so that we can select each line and verify if each line has 8 images or not. \
1.	Checkers cannot move backward.
       If users try to move it backward, we see the message ‘Please Wait
2.	When a user clicks on restart 
       We see the message Select an Orange piece to move
       We can also verify that on the given board 
       on the first div.line
       src = ‘me1.gif’ on certain spaces for say colour Orange 
       src = ‘you1.gif’ - This is for blue
3.	When the first orange is moved, we can verify that we see the message ‘make a move’
4.	We are not able to move immediately until the other player makes a move. It says ‘Please Wait’
5.	If we do any illegal move it says - Please wait
6.	If clicking elsewhere other than orange - Click on your orange piece, then click where you want to move it.
7.	If trying to move horizontally - Move Diagonally only`
8.  The restart button keeps all the checkers in its place.
9.  The rules button exists and clicking navigates the user to a new page in a new tab and in the same browser - Improvement. Currently, the rules page is opened on the same tab and the checkers page is lost and not a good user experience. It should open in a new tab.
